# Statistical Finance and Financial Machine Learning for Systematic Trading

A structured 2 year four-course learning sequence progressing from foundational statistics and machine learning to advanced financial ML and professional-grade quant research practices.

---

## **Course 1 — Foundations of Statistical Learning and Quantitative Trading - 5 months**
<!-- 5 months as ISLP and SDAFE has many labs + end of unit questions -->
**Objective**  
Build core statistical intuition, basic machine learning understanding, and the ability to code and evaluate simple quantitative trading strategies.

**Primary Texts**
- *Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering by David Ruppert and David S. Matteson* 
- *An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLP) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani*  
- *Quantitative Trading Strategies Using Python: Technical Analysis, Statistical Testing, and Machine Learning by Liu Peng*

**Key Topics**
- Probability, estimation, regression, and inference
- Bias–variance tradeoff and model validation
- Supervised learning fundamentals
- Market mechanics and basic trading rules
- Coding and backtesting introductory strategies

**Capstone Project**  
**Single-Asset Strategy Research Notebook**  
Students design, implement, and evaluate a single-asset trading strategy (e.g., momentum or mean reversion). The project must include:
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Feature construction and exploratory analysis
- Strategy rules and basic ML enhancement (optional)
- Backtesting with clear assumptions
- Performance evaluation and discussion of overfitting risks

**Outcome**  
Students can analyze financial data, implement simple strategies in Python, and understand common sources of overfitting and statistical error.

## **Course 2 — Algorithmic Trading Systems and Machine Learning Workflows - 4 months**
<!-- 4 months as course 1 covers most if not all of theoretical math/stats knowledge needed and there are no labs/questions.
The first book will take me 1 week to read: very low prerequisites( could've been in course 1 honestly). 2nd book will be read in parallel with the 3rd book and should take me 3-3.5 months to read. I'll start working on the project as soon as course starts as course 1 gives me a decent background to start .
-->
**Objective**  
Transition from toy strategies to realistic algorithmic trading systems with robust backtesting, execution awareness, and ML-driven workflows.

**Primary Texts**
- *Successful Algorithmic Trading by Michael L. Halls-Moore* 
- *Advanced Algorithmic Trading by Michael L. Halls-Moore*  
- *Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading by Stefan Jansen*

**Key Topics**
- Backtesting bias, transaction costs, and slippage
- Walk-forward validation and time-series cross-validation
- Feature engineering for financial data
- Portfolio construction and evaluation
- Practical ML pipelines for trading systems

**Capstone Project**  
**Multi-Asset ML Trading System**  
Students build an end-to-end ML trading pipeline across multiple assets. Requirements include:
- Feature engineering across assets and time
- Model training with time-series-aware validation
- Portfolio construction logic
- Transaction cost and slippage modeling
- Walk-forward backtesting and performance attribution

**Outcome**  
Students can design, test, and evaluate algorithmic strategies with realistic assumptions and end-to-end ML workflows.

## **Course 3 — Financial Time Series, Portfolio Construction, and Risk Modeling - 6 months**
<!-- All books in this course are grad level and contain exercises for every chapter(except Paleologo's Book which only has exercises for some chapters). I'll start working on the project as soon as course starts as course 1 gives me a decent background to start. -->
**Objective**  
Develop a deep understanding of financial time series behavior, volatility dynamics, and portfolio-level risk management.

**Primary Texts**
- *Analysis of Financial Time Series by Ruey S. Tsay*  
- *The Elements of Quantitative Investing by Giuseppe A. Paleologo*
- *Portfolio Optimization: Theory and Application by Daniel P. Palomar*

**Key Topics**
- Stationarity, ARMA, GARCH, and regime models
- Volatility modeling and diagnostics
- Portfolio optimization under constraints
- Estimation error, turnover, and transaction costs
- Risk metrics beyond Sharpe (drawdowns, tail risk)

**Capstone Project**  
**Risk-Aware Portfolio Strategy**  
Students construct and evaluate a portfolio strategy emphasizing risk control. The project must include:
- Time-series modeling of returns and volatility
- Portfolio optimization under constraints
- Explicit turnover and transaction cost controls
- Stress testing and drawdown analysis
- Comparison against naive benchmarks

**Outcome**  
Students can model asset dynamics, construct portfolios robustly, and manage risk at the system level.

## **Course 4 — Advanced Financial Machine Learning and Quantitative Research Methods - 6 months**

**Objective**  
Master advanced ML theory and learn research practices that prevent false discoveries in financial ML.
<!-- All books in this course are grad level and contain exercises for every chapter. I'll start working on the project as soon as course starts as course 1 and 2 gives me a very strong background to start(the project for this course can be done after course 2. -->
**Primary Texts**
- *The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) by by Jerome Friedman, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani*  
- *Advances in Financial Machine Learning by by Marcos Lopez de Prado*
- *Machine Learning in Finance: from theory to practice by Igor Halperin, Matthew Dixon, and Paul A. Bilokon*

**Key Topics**
- High-dimensional ML and regularization
- Trees, ensembles, and nonlinear methods
- Financial labeling and meta-labeling
- Purged and embargoed cross-validation
- Research hygiene and overfitting control

**Capstone Project**  
**Research-Grade Alpha Discovery Study**  
Students conduct a full alpha research study with strict research hygiene:
- Hypothesis formulation and economic rationale
- Feature and label design
- Purged/embargoed cross-validation
- Statistical significance and robustness testing
- Clear documentation of assumptions and failure modes

**Outcome**  
Students can critically evaluate quant research, design scalable ML experiments, and apply advanced methods responsibly in financial markets.

## **Final Program Capstone — End-to-End Quantitative Trading System - 3 months**
<!-- 3 months seems realistic -->
**Objective**  
Integrate all prior coursework into a single, coherent quantitative trading system.

**Capstone Description**  
Students design, document, and evaluate a complete systematic trading strategy, including:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and model selection
- Signal generation and portfolio construction
- Transaction cost and risk modeling
- Walk-forward and stress-tested backtesting
- Performance attribution and post-mortem analysis

**Deliverables**
- Fully reproducible Python research repository
