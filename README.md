# Quantitative Finance & Systematic Trading  
## A Four-Course Research-to-Production Sequence

**Prerequisites:**  Linear algebra, common probability distributions, basic hypothesis testing, multivariable calculus, proficiency in Python/R, familiarity with object-oriented programming.

This sequence is designed to take a learner from **statistical foundations** through **market mechanics**, **portfolio construction**, and finally **financial machine learning**, ending with a full end-to-end capstone. The emphasis is on **research discipline, robustness, and implementation realism**, not retail-style signal chasing.

## Course 1: Statistical Foundations for Quantitative Trading

**Primary Texts**
- *Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering* — Ruppert & Matteson  
- *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* — James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani  
- *Quantitative Trading Strategies Using Python* — Liu Peng  
- *Successful Algorithmic Trading* — Michael Halls-Moore  

**Focus**
- Probability distributions and stylized facts of financial data  
- Statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and multiple-testing risk  
- Linear and non-linear predictive models  
- Model validation, cross-validation, and overfitting detection  
- Translating statistical models into simple systematic strategies  

### Course Capstone
**Title:** *Statistical Validation of Predictive Signals in Financial Markets*  

**Description:**  
Design, test, and statistically validate a set of predictive signals (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, volatility-based). Emphasis is on correct hypothesis formulation, out-of-sample testing, and distinguishing statistical significance from economic relevance.

**Deliverables**
- Research report (hypotheses, methodology, results, limitations)  
- Clean, reproducible Python code  
- Explicit treatment of data-snooping and overfitting risk

## Course 2: Market Microstructure & Trading System Engineering

**Primary Texts**
- *Advanced Algorithmic Trading* — Michael Halls-Moore  
- *An Introduction to Market Microstructure Theory* — Andreas Krause  
- *Testing and Tuning Market Trading Systems: Algorithms in C++* — Timothy Masters  
- *An Introduction to Mathematical Finance with Applications* — Arlie O. Petters  

**Focus**
- Market microstructure and price formation  
- Order types, execution mechanics, and transaction costs  
- Event-driven trading system design  
- Backtesting realism vs naïve vectorized approaches  
- Performance attribution and system robustness  

### Course Capstone
**Title:** *Design and Implementation of an Event-Driven Trading System*  

**Description:**  
Build an event-driven backtesting and execution simulator that models realistic order handling, slippage, and transaction costs. Integrate at least one strategy developed in Course 1.

**Deliverables**
- Event-driven backtesting engine (Python with performance-critical components in C++ or optimized Python)  
- Execution cost and slippage models  
- Technical design documentation explaining architectural decisions

## Course 3: Financial Time Series & Portfolio Construction

**Primary Texts**
- *Analysis of Financial Time Series* — Ruey S. Tsay  
- *Portfolio Optimization: Theory and Application* — Daniel P. Palomar  
- *The Elements of Quantitative Investing* — Giuseppe Paleologo
- *Portfolio Management in Continuous Time* — Palgrave MacMillan

<!-- Portfolio Management in Continuous Time will be released March 2026, if I can read it using my university student priviledges it'll be in this course-->

**Focus**
- Time-series modeling (ARIMA, GARCH, regime behavior)  
- Volatility and correlation dynamics  
- Mean-variance optimization and its limitations  
- Risk-based and robust portfolio construction  
- Portfolio-level performance evaluation  

### Course Capstone
**Title:** *Volatility-Aware Portfolio Optimization Across Market Regimes*  

**Description:**  
Develop a portfolio construction framework that incorporates volatility forecasting and robust optimization. Compare traditional mean-variance portfolios with risk-parity or alternative risk-based approaches.

**Deliverables**
- Research paper with empirical results  
- Portfolio optimizer implementation  
- Stress tests across different market regimes

## Course 4: Financial Machine Learning & Robust Alpha Research

**Primary Texts**
- *Machine Learning in Finance* — Dixon, Halperin, Bilokon  
- *Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading* — Stefan Jansen  
- *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* — Marcos López de Prado
- *Advanced Portfolio Management* — Giuseppe Paleologo

**Focus**
- Financial data structures and labeling methods  
- Feature engineering with economic intuition  
- Cross-validation for time-dependent data  
- Ensemble methods and non-linear models  
- Overfitting control, backtest statistics, and robustness diagnostics  

### Course Capstone
**Title:** *Machine-Learning-Driven Alpha Discovery with Robust Validation*  

**Description:**  
Conduct a full ML research project: define an economic hypothesis, engineer features, train models, and validate results using purged cross-validation and appropriate performance metrics.

**Deliverables**
- Research-grade paper  
- ML pipeline (data, features, models, validation)  
- Explicit discussion of failure modes and fragility

## Final Program Capstone

### Title
**End-to-End Systematic Trading Strategy: From Hypothesis to Deployment**

### Description
Design, implement, and evaluate a complete systematic trading strategy that integrates:
- Statistical modeling (Course 1)  
- Execution-aware system design (Course 2)  
- Portfolio construction and risk management (Course 3)  
- Machine learning with rigorous validation (Course 4)  

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive research paper (economic rationale, methodology, results)  
- Full codebase covering data ingestion, modeling, portfolio construction, and backtesting  
- Risk analysis, stress testing, and post-mortem on potential failure scenarios
