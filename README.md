# Statistical Finance & Financial Machine Learning  
## A Research-First, Implementation-Driven Quantitative Trading Sequence

---

## Program Philosophy

This four-course sequence is designed as a self study guide for students interested in working as a buy side quantitative trader/developer/researcher. The first two course covers everything you need to know before applying for junior to mid level quantitative trader/developer/researcher at buy-side firms or to become an algorithmic trader. The last two course are geared towards quantitative research(writing papers, reading papers, doing novel research). 

**Prerequisites**: Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics up to a level that has covered common probability distributions and basic hypothesis testing, multivariable calculus, experience with writing code in python/C/C++, and object oriented programming.

The curriculum follows a deliberate progression:

**Statistical foundations & predictive modeling → System engineering & execution → Time-series econometrics & portfolio theory → Financial ML & research rigor**

Throughout the program:
- Research discipline is prioritized over backtest performance
- Economic plausibility precedes model construction
- Portfolio-level risk dominates single-signal optimization
- Every result must survive adversarial statistical scrutiny

**Format:** Research + implementation  
**Duration:** ~21–24 months  
**Outcome:** Buy-side–ready quant research capability

## Final Note

This program is intentionally demanding.

Its purpose is not to teach **how to trade**, but to teach **how to think like a quantitative researcher who understands the many ways strategies fail, and how to build systems that survive real-world deployment**.

The emphasis on **research rigor, statistical validity, and execution realism** prepares students to contribute meaningfully to institutional systematic trading operations.
